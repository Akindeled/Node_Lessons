From this course so far... we are begining to see and appreciate the use of javascripts like othr of it's conterparts.
Not just as a web compiles language.

We can export a file by setting the variables we wish to export in a module.export object which can equally be accessed in the other file by the use of require()

Require() function does the work of grabbing the stuff that is exportable from the original file and them return it to the other file as an object.


There ar built - in - modueles as well as custom modules.These built in function may include :
1.OS-Operating System
2.PATH
3.HTTP
4.FS
